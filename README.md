# CSE4322SQL
In order to run the project from the repo after pulling you will need to do the following
*Ensure your python version is 11 or lower, the chat gpt api does not work with python 12
*pip install openai
*pip install dotenv
*create a chat gpt api key
*YOU MUST HOOK PAYMENT INFORMATION TO THE KEY FOR IT TO WORK. Do not worry, I have checked and actual cost is extremely minimal(.0015$ per 1000 tokens) and you get 120$ credit before they charge you. I will ensure that none of the calls to the api are in loops  Unless you feed it the entire Lord of The Rings and ask for an equivalent sized fan fic you arent going to see anything charged to your account.
create a .env file with the line
"API_KEY=YOUR_API_key"
